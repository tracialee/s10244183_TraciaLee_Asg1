A website created from the inspiration of keshi's official website.
 
## Design Process

As a fan of keshi's music and an often visitor of his website, it gave me an inspiration of recreating a website about him. the enquiry form on the contact page can allow fans or listeners to send messages that are constructive to his team. the wireframe of my website made with the XD app is in this forlder as well. from this website i hope that users woule be able to buy merhandise by keshi's team, provide feedbacks that they wish to provide through the enquiry form and to also find out more about keshi and his work.

## Features

in the index page, the home page. users can find out more about keshi and follow his social media and keep up on information or new updates about him. from the shopping page, users can buy merchandises and proceed to the checkout page to make payment. for the contact us page, users can fill up the enquiry form to provide information or look for keshi if theres any interest of collaboration or more.

## Technologies Used

for my wireframe, i used the adobe XD app to create it.
for my guidance and help i used google and the slides lecture.
for my links and images i used google to do my research.

## Testing

submitting an empty form an error message about the required fields appears, an invalid email address and a relevant error message appears and the form with all inputs valid and a success message appears.
